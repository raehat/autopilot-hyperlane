# ABOUT
Deployment of hyperlane and warp routes is quite challenging as it is completely technical. 
Hyperlane needs to be deployed on every chain, and warp routes need to be 
deployed between every chains, so process of deployment should be smooth.

Autopilot is an automated tool which can be used to deploy hyperlane and warp routes between
chains in a minute! Any non technical person can even do it, just use our web app, enter
the details asked for, and we will deploy a web app for token transfer for you!

Imagine being clicks away from a token transfer web app for your tokens and chains. Automating 
deployment of hyperlane warp routes should be taken very seriously, as if it is smooth, more
people will join the network, every day.

AutoPilot Hyperlane is an innovative tool designed to streamline the deployment of hyperlanes
and warp routes across interconnected chains. This remarkable automation tool simplifies the complex
process of establishing these crucial connections. By doing so, it significantly reduces the manual effort
and potential errors associated with such deployments. Moreover, AutoPilot Hyperlane takes automation a step further by creating a user-friendly web application URL that provides easy access to the generated warp routes.

# HOW TO RUN ON LOCAL MACHINE

1) copy the git url
2) open terminal and type
   
   ```
   git clone <git-repo-url>
   cd autopilot-hyperlane

   cd autohyperlane/autohyperlane
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3) once react app is running, now you need to run the server
4) open terminal
   
   ```
   cd se
   node ind.js
   ```
5) If working with local chains, please install foundry and use forge
6) To start a new local node, open terminal and type
   
   ```
   anvil
   ```
7) Transfer funds to account if no funds are present

That's it! This is just the beginning, we can add more complexity to this product and make it more useful. Feel free to communicate with me if you have any ideas or open a new issue!
